                            - The heatmap shows the proportion of pass outcomes (`passResult`) for different combinations of field zones and defensive coverage schemes.

                                - Darker near **Complete:** The offense is effective against this coverage in the corresponding field zone & vice versa for Lighter or transparent shade.
                    
                            **Why It Matters:**

                            **Key Insight:**
                            - This heatmap helps pinpoint which defensive strategies were most effective in disrupting offensive plays across different field zones.
                            - A darker color near "**Complete**" suggests the offense thrives against that coverage in certain zones. A darker color near "**Incomplete**" or "**Intercepted**" points to defensive schemes that are highly effective in shutting down the offense.

                            - The circular chart is divided into four sections, each representing a field zone:
                                - **Opponent Red Zone** (0-25 yards)
                                - **Midfield** (26-50 yards)
                                - **Own Territory** (51-75 yards)
                                - **Own Deep Zone** (76-100 yards).
                            - Each bar in the chart represents a defensive pass coverage scheme (e.g., Cover - 0, Cover - 1, etc ) used in that field zone.
                            - The length of the bar shows how often that coverage was employed.

                            **Why It Matters:**
                            - **Peak of the Bar:** Longer bars highlight defensive schemes that were frequently used and potentially more effective against offensive plays in that zone.
                            - **Color:** Colors differentiate field zones, making it easier to compare defensive strategies across areas of the field.

                            **Key Insight:**
                            - Use this chart to identify field zones where the offense struggled most against certain defensive coverages. For example, the chart might reveal that offenses completed more passes in the **Own Territory**.

                        **How to Use It:**
                        - Start with the heatmap to identify offensive performance trends (e.g., dark colors for "Complete" or "Incomplete").
                        - Use the circular bar plot to dig deeper into the details, such as which defensive schemes were most frequently used and where offenses struggled the most.

                        This visualization provides a clear breakdown of offensive performance against defensive strategies across key field zones. It helps answer:
                        - Where does your offense excel or struggle against specific coverage types?
                        - Which field zones present the biggest challenges for your plays?
                        - How can you adapt your offense to exploit weaknesses in defensive schemes?

                        By combining the heatmap with the circular bar plot, we can develop strategies to counter defensive coverage and optimize offensive performance.

                            - **Darker colors:** Indicate where certain outcomes are more frequent:
                            - Darker near **Complete:** Suggests the receiver alignment was effective in producing completions in the corresponding field zone.
                            - Darker near **Incomplete** or **Intercepted:** Suggests the alignment was less effective, or the defense disrupted the play.
                            - Lighter or transparent colors indicate negligible or less frequent outcomes.

                            **Why It Matters:**
                            - Highlights where offenses excel or struggle based on their receiver alignments in specific field zones.
                            - Identifies which alignments lead to successful or unsuccessful pass outcomes.

                            - This heatmap helps pinpoint receiver alignments that worked best in specific field zones.
                            - For example, a darker shade near "**Complete**" suggests a 3x2 alignment was effective in the **Midfield**.

                            - **Opponent Red Zone** (0-25 yards)
                            - **Midfield** (26-50 yards)
                            - **Own Territory** (51-75 yards)
                            - **Own Deep Zone** (76-100 yards).
                            - Each bar represents a receiver alignment (`receiverAlignment`) used in that field zone (e.g., 3x1, 2x2, 3x2).
                            - The length of the bar shows how frequently that alignment was used in the corresponding field zone.

                            **Why It Matters:**
                            - **Peak of the Bar:** Longer bars highlight alignments that were frequently used in specific field zones.
                            - **Color:** Colors differentiate field zones, making it easier to compare how offenses set up their receivers in different areas of the field.

                        - Start with the heatmap to identify where receiver alignments were most effective (e.g., dark colors near "Complete" or "Incomplete").
                        - Use the circular bar plot to explore the frequency of each alignment in different field zones and correlate it with the heatmap trends.

                        This visualization provides a clear breakdown of how offensive receiver alignments were employed and their impact on pass outcomes across key field zones. It helps answer:
                        - Which receiver alignments are most effective in specific field zones?
                        - Where do alignments succeed or fail based on pass outcomes?
                        - How can you adjust receiver alignments to maximize success in different field zones?

                        By combining the heatmap with the circular bar plot, we can analyze offensive setups more effectively and adapt strategies to counter defensive alignments.
