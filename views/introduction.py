    #### Introduction
    To begin with, I am very thankful to **DFO** ([**DeMarkco Butler**](https://ucmathletics.com/staff-directory/demarkco-butler/388)) for all his support throughout this project & 
    I truly appreciate the live game valuable insights from [**Coach Josh Lamberson's**](https://themiaa.com/news/2023/12/6/football-josh-lamberson-named-afca-division-ii-super-region-coach-of-the-year.aspx), who is the ***AFCA Super Region II Coach of the Year 2023*** and the ***2023 MIAA Coach of the Year***.

    **Objective 1**: Scouting players is arguably the most crucial task for NFL teams in their quest to acquire top talent. The 32 teams meticulously evaluate and compare players by stacking them against each other, such as ***"this player vs. that player"***. Traditionally, this process involves extensive analysis of player performance, character assessment, and data evaluation.
    **Bottom Line**: Make smarter decisions, faster—with data we can trust. While film study remains important, this scenario gameplay simulator is the icing on the cake, providing clear insights more quickly than traditional methods, showing you exactly how your football strategy will play out—all before we even step on the field.

    **Objective 2**: As NFL offenses continue to innovate in the face of aggressive defensive schemes, short-passing plays have emerged as the cornerstone of modern strategy. 
    With defenses emphasizing pressure and coverage schemes to limit deep balls, offenses are responding by capitalizing on quick, efficient passes **DINKING** & **DUNKING** their way to dominance. **The numbers back it up**: Short passes, particularly to the *middle*, *right*, and *left* have consistently shown higher success rates in sustaining drives and avoiding costly turnovers. 
    Teams that master these plays gain an edge in controlling the *clock*, converting key *downs*, and maximizing *Expected Points Added (EPA)* per play. 

    **Makes Smatter decisions! → The numbers back it up! → For real? → Yes**
    
    - *But can we use this for Scouting? How it will help for Scouting?*
    - *How pre-snap formations and tendencies could predict post-snap outcomes? What relation it has with Scouting?*
    - *How can we predict yard gains and determine the most effective offensive strategies in different scenarios? How can we leverage scouting for individual players?*
   
    This project provides answers to such questions in to **3 main playgrounds** by visualizes the *trends*, analyzing *quaterbacks-receivers patterns*, *strategies*, hands on with *real time game play scenario simulator* & revealing not only what happens but also why.

    #### Methodology
    The Gameplay Simulator requires extensively engineering and transforming of raw tracking data data to definie game situations like quarter, down, and yards to go, then analyzing offensive and defensive player data to train machine learning models that predict yard gains and strategies with high accuracy where we used **8 weeks data for training** and **tested on 9th week** and achieved above 80% accurate results.
       
    Dink & Dunk Report requires extensively engineering and transforming raw players-play data to extract meaningful insights. For the Dink & Dunk Report, we identified pass plays and categorized them into short & deep pass strategies by analyzing formations, down and distance, player routes, receiver alignment, and defensive coverage, despite the tracking data not providing explicit details. 
    
  
    For Quarterback’s Radar, we tracked receiver positions and distance, then applied advanced algorithms to determine the best receiver for passes before the snap, integrating this with a video animations where it highlights the Best Receiver and tracks the route ran by the receiver so we can look at the strategy indepth in future.

        2. **Offensive and Defensive Data Analysis**: For the offense, we identified all 11 players, their routes, positions, formations, play types (pass or run), scores, winning probabilities, and individual performances. For the defense, we analyzed the 11 defensive players, their coverage types (zone or man), positions, formations, play types, scores, winning probabilities, and individual performances.
        3. **Data Transformation and Cleaning**: Since the tracking data did not provide all necessary details, we transformed and cleaned the data to create a comprehensive dataset suitable for machine learning models.
        4. **Model Training and Prediction**: Using the processed data, we trained machine learning models to predict yard gain outcomes and offensive strategies. This simulator empowers coaches with data-driven insights to make informed decisions during games.

        After running the Dink & Dunk pipeline methodology, we cleaned the data for all 32 NFL teams and found a total of **8,704 pass plays**, with **82.81%** being **short passes**. Insights from ***Coach Lamberson*** guided me on why NFL teams are using these short passes also known as "**Dink and Dunk**". Based on this, we categorized them into types of short passes and found that *short middle, left, and right* were the most used also we extracted their *success rate, first down rate, average passing yards per play, and EPA*. The analysis showed that short middle passes had a ***Success Rate of 69.60%, a First Down Rate of 56.44%, Yards Per Play of 7.38 yards***, and an ***EPA Per Play of 0.18***.

        Going more granular, we analyzed individual teams and their players. The ridge line plot above illustrates the performance of the **Philadelphia Eagles**, showing that they were most efficient in ***short middle passes, with a median EPA of 0.90***.
        - **To interpret the plot**: the ***black line*** represents the ***mean line***, and the ***white line*** is the ***median***. When the mean is greater than the median in Expected Points Added (EPA), it suggests that there are a few high-value plays that significantly increase the average, while most plays are of lower value. Conversely, if the median is greater than the mean, it indicates that most plays are performing well, but there are some outliers (poor plays) that are dragging the average down.

    #### Conclusion
    Based on the two playgrounds discussed above:

    1. :violet[**Gameplay Scenario**]: We achieved 80% accuracy on Week 9's unseen data, which shows that we can rely on this initial model and the best part is that we can explore any player across 32 NFL teams or even within the same team to see if our game plan will work out or not. Moreover, video film is mandatory for scouting a player, but having this simulator is like the icing on the cake which makes things faster for us and helping us make decisions based on data.

    2. :violet[**Dink & Dunk Strategy**]: Regarding this strategy, the 2022 data indicates that more yards were gained in the middle location across all teams with higher pass completion rate, higher first down conversion rate and all this claims are backed up with the EPA median favoring short middle passes. So, consider using short middle passes to create pressure on defesne and gain more yards. However, it’s also important to analyze pass-receivers preferred locations and routes provided in the Dink and Dunk strategy report.

    Lastly, while I'd love to dive deeper, space constraints and the small sample size limit me. However, to sum it up, we have a comprehensive [**dashboard**](https://perfectly-imperfect.streamlit.app/) that breaks everything down in detail. It lets us explore custom players and game scenarios to determine if an offensive plan will work and understand which strategies might be used. With trends and patterns for both offense and defense, we can also filter data at the individual team level with ridge charts and tables that highlight tendencies and patterns, making data-driven decisions much easier.
