        **What is QB's Radar**? \n
        QB's Radar is a model designed to help quarterbacks identify the best receiver for a play. It uses two advanced methods:
        
        1. **Strategic Receiver**: This is the receiver predicted by a technique called **Progressive Widening Search**.
        2. **Primary Receiver**: This is the receiver predicted by a different method called **Beam Target Search**.
        3. **Best Receiver**: When both models agree on the receiver, and it matches *most of the actual game choice*.

        The model’s insights are especially valuable for **Deep Passes**, where decision-making is critical.

        **Why QB's Radar Matters**:

        By using QB's Radar, quarterbacks can improve offensive efficiency and yardage on deep plays.
        
        1. **Improves Decision-Making**: Helps quarterbacks avoid risky plays and identify receivers with better potential.
        2. **Highlights Missed Opportunities**: Shows how passing to the predicted receiver could have changed the game.
        3. **Deep Pass Excellence**: Excels at identifying the best options for deep passes, optimizing offensive strategy.

        With QB's Radar, quarterbacks can improve offensive efficiency, reduce turnovers, and make smarter choices to maximize yardage and 
        game impact.

        #### :violet[Missed Opportunities] and Use Cases

        1. **Incomplete Passes**:
            - In several plays, the model predicted a **Strategic Receiver**, but the quarterback targeted a different receiver, resulting in an **incomplete pass**.
            - **Potential Outcome**: If the QB had passed to the predicted receiver, the outcome could have been a completion with better yardage.

        2. **Safe vs. Risky Choices**:
            - The model often identifies a **safer receiver** (Strategic Receiver) who might gain fewer yards but minimizes risk (e.g., avoiding interceptions or turnovers).
            - **Example**: The QB passed to the Primary Receiver, resulting in a completion but with increased risk. The Strategic Receiver would have been a safer option.

        3. **Game-Changing Potential**:
            - In some cases, the model’s Strategic Receiver prediction identified receivers with significantly higher yardage potential than the Primary Receiver.
            - **Example**: Passing to the Strategic Receiver could have resulted in a significant yardage gain and potentially altered the game outcome.
